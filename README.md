## Project Proposal

### Summary

Our project goal is to find and mine a diamond ore within a given time. In the game, diamond ores are very rare and usually hard to mine. Therefore, we believe this is a challenging goal for our project. Our project takes a chosen seed as input, which makes sure that the new generated world has diamond ores and everything we need to mine them. For example, the world must contain iron ores, otherwise it is impossible to mine diamond ores without an iron shovel. The output of our project is a log describing the task result. The log includes:
1. Whether the agent found a diamond ore or not.
2. Whether the agent managed to mine a diamond ore or not.
3. How long did it take for the agent to complete or fail the task.
4. If the agent failed the task, what is the cause. For example, run out of time; death caused by hunger; death caused by zombie; death caused by creeper etc.
